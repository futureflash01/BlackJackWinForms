# ðŸŽµ Sound Assets & ðŸŽ´ Card Assets

This folder is reserved for asset references used in the game. To keep the repository lightweight and avoid unnecessary bloat, the actual sound effects and card images have **not** been included here.

Instead, you can download the original assets directly from their respective sources:

## ðŸŽµ Sound Effects
Royalty-free sound effects used in this project can be found on:

**Pixabay (Free Sound Effects):**  
ðŸ”— [https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/)

Pixabay provides a wide selection of sound effects under a royalty-free license. You are free to browse and choose your own sounds, or use the ones referenced in the game by downloading similar ones from the link above.

## ðŸŽ´ Playing Card Images
The playing card vector images were sourced from the open-source project:

**Google's Vector Playing Cards:**  
ðŸ”— [https://code.google.com/archive/p/vector-playing-cards/downloads](https://code.google.com/archive/p/vector-playing-cards/downloads)

These high-quality SVG and PNG playing cards are freely available and customizable. You can download and use them in your version of the project by placing the PNG images in this folder (`Resources/Cards`).

## Why These Files Are Not Included
To keep the repository minimal and easy to clone or download, all large media files (images and sounds) are excluded. This allows users to customize their experience by selecting assets of their choice and avoids bloating the overall size of the project.
