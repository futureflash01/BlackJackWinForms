## 📖 How to Play

**Blackjack** is a common card game played in casinos. It uses a standard deck of 52 cards and the goal is to get close to or equal to 21 and beat the dealer!
If you would like to learn how to play, please watch this very informative and in depth YouTube video by [Blackjack Apprenticeship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PljDuynF-j0)


**Ride the Bus** is a fairly popular drinking game for college students. It's pretty straight forward and starts out with the player placing an initial bet. The player then answers a series of questions and every correct answer doubles your bet and advances
them to the next stage.

These questions go as follows:
The player is first prompted to guess color of the next card, then has to guess if the next card is higher/lower than the previous one,
then has to guess if the value of the next card falls between the two first ones, and then finally prompts the player to guess the suit of the next card. Answering all these series of questions correctly would ideally result in a jackpot.


#### IMPORTANT NOTE:
This project does NOT include, promote, or condone gambling. Gambling can lead to a serious addiciton and has ruined many lives and successful marriages. Please do not
gamble under any circumstance. These games are just recreations of the originals using my favorite programming language. I disabled any form of betting or saving any scores
to prevent the habit of a potential gambling addiction. Even though it's all digital and no real currency is used, I still want these games to be fun and entertaining.
